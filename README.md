# Axiom

Axiom is a conceptual project exploring how a long-established mobility company could operate in 2050—after autonomy, AI mediation, and shifting user values have reshaped transportation.

This repository is a design-led thinking space and technical demo, not a production product.

## Vision

In 2050, people don't rent vehicles. They describe how they need to move, and the system returns movement stories—orchestrated plans across autonomous fleets, rail, and micro-mobility.

Axiom is:
- A guardian of movement for families, workers, and cities
- An AI-mediated layer that translates messy human intentions into structured plans
- A custodian of trust in a world of opaque, fully autonomous systems
