# Axiom

Axiom is a conceptual project exploring how a long-established mobility company could operate in 2050 — after autonomy, AI mediation, and shifting user values have reshaped mobility.

This repository is a design-led thinking space and technical demo, not a production-ready product.

## Project philosophy

Axiom is built around a few core ideas about how mobility works in 2050.

- Legacy mobility companies behave as quiet infrastructure
- Vehicles are autonomous and abundant
- Time, privacy, and cognitive calm are valued more than money
- AI agents mediate most decisions
- Trust and reliability replace aggressive marketing

## Core features

Axiom focuses on experience-first mobility rather than vehicles or ownership.

- People choose experience modes, not car models
- Modes define interior, behavior, and journey rules
- Five modes: Focus, Family, Solo, Private, Shared
- Pricing adapts to urgency, autonomy confidence, and trust
- Planning ahead reduces system cost and energy usage
- Guest-first usage with progressive trust over time
