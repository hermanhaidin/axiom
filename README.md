# Axiom

Axiom is a conceptual project exploring how a long-established mobility company could operate in 2050 — after autonomy, AI mediation, and shifting user values have reshaped mobility.

This repository is a design-led thinking space and demo, not a production-ready product.

## Project philosophy

Axiom is built around a few core ideas about how mobility works in 2050.

### A legacy company as infrastructure

The company behind Axiom is over 100 years old.
It survived digitalization, platform shifts, and autonomous vehicles.

By 2050, it no longer behaves like a consumer brand.
It operates quietly as mobility infrastructure — reliable, invisible, and embedded in daily life.

### Mobility is allocated, not rented

People no longer rent vehicles.
They allocate:
- time
- privacy
- attention

Vehicles are autonomous and abundant.
The value lies in the journey’s conditions, not the car itself.

### Time and privacy are more valuable than money

Money still matters, but it is no longer the primary decision factor.
Users optimize for:
- uninterrupted time
- personal space
- cognitive calm

Axiom is designed around reducing friction, noise, and decision fatigue.

### AI mediates decisions

Most choices are made by AI agents that:
- understand intent
- negotiate trade-offs
- make decisions on the user’s behalf

Axiom integrates into these AI-mediated flows instead of competing for attention.

### Quiet brands, not loud marketing

Traditional marketing feels primitive in 2050:
- no loud campaigns
- no constant promotions
- no aggressive brand presence

Axiom relies on reliability and trust.
