# Vision Script

This document describes how Axiom feels in use—not what it does, but what it's like.

It's not a requirements spec. It's a set of scenes, voices, and moments that make this future company feel real.

---

## 1. Premise

Axiom is a long-established mobility company in 2050, born in the era of rental counters and loyalty cards, now operating in a world where autonomy is default, AI mediates most decisions, and people care less about "owning a car" and more about time, safety, identity, and planetary impact.

---

## 2. The company in 2050

### Origin

Founded in 1912 as a traditional car rental brand, with airport counters and printed contracts.

### Inflection points

- **2030s** — Fleet shifts to mostly electric, first experiments with partial autonomy.
- **2040s** — Company repositions from "rental" to "mobility stewardship", starts managing other providers' fleets too.

### In 2050, Axiom sees itself as

- A guardian of movement for families, workers, and cities.
- An AI-mediated layer that translates messy human intentions into orchestrated mobility plans.
- A custodian of trust in a world of opaque, fully autonomous systems.

### Tone of voice

Calm, competent, slightly nostalgic, never hyped.

Examples:
- "We've translated your request into 3 possible movement stories."
- "Last time you traveled with us (2039), you preferred fewer vehicle switches."
- "In 2050, our role isn't just to move bodies, but to protect headspace."

---

## 3. Cast

### Alex — 42, Berlin, 2 kids

Grew up with ride-hailing and carshare apps. Remembers when driving yourself was normal.

- Values psychological safety, predictability for kids, low cognitive load.
- Feels weird about fully opaque AI decisions—wants understandable choices.
- Trust level: Trusted (long history with Axiom)

### Maria — 31, Lisbon, remote worker

Rarely drives manually. Grew up with climate anxiety, doesn't want to feel like "the bad guy" when moving around.

- Values low emissions, aesthetic experiences, and not wasting time managing logistics.
- Prefers quiet, ad-free environments.
- Trust level: Recognized (uses guest alias, hasn't provided name)

### The company — internal voice

A composite of planners, legacy ops people, and new AI systems. Constantly negotiating between legacy promises (loyalty, service) and new realities (autonomy, algorithmic mediation).

---

## 4. Experience modes

Axiom doesn't sell vehicles—it offers movement stories. But behind every story, the system applies **experience modes** as soft tags that shape the journey's character.

| Mode | Promise | Typical signals |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Calm environment for concentration | Work mentions, solo travel, "quiet" or "productive" intent |
| **Family** | Flexible space, stress-free arrival | Kids mentioned, luggage, "comfortable" or "relaxed" intent |
| **Solo** | Efficient, minimal overhead | Single traveler, short trips, "quick" or "simple" intent |
| **Private** | Maximum privacy and control | Explicit privacy request, sensitive context |
| **Shared** | Lower cost through aligned intent | Budget mentions, flexibility on timing, openness to co-travelers |

Modes are inferred, not selected. The system shows which mode it applied and why. Users can override.

---

## 5. Scenes

### Scene 1 — Home: intention instead of booking

Alex opens the Axiom app to plan a family trip. The home screen has no car photos, no search form with dates and locations.

**Screen: Home**

A single, central text field with faint prompt:

> "Tell us how you need to move. We'll handle the rest."

Subtext below:

> "We coordinate autonomous fleets, rail, micro-mobility, and stay-local options on your behalf."

Hint examples:
- "Week-long Europe trip with 2 kids, we don't want to drive too much"
- "Commuting during a heatwave, need safest route for 6 weeks"
- "3-day shoot, need quiet vehicles and reliable power on the move"

**Input**

Alex types:

> "We're a family of 4, leaving from Berlin in July for a 10-day Europe trip. 2 kids, 4 suitcases. We used to rent vans from you, now not sure what's best. I don't want to drive the whole time."

**Screen: Understanding**

The UI shows the system's structured interpretation:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Trip type | Family vacation |
| Timeframe | ~10 days in July |
| Origin | Berlin metro area |
| Party | 2 adults, 2 children |
| Luggage | 4 suitcases |
| Constraints | Low driving load |
| Budget | Moderate *(assumed from history)* |
| Mode applied | **Family** |

Items marked "assumed" can be tapped to adjust.

Legacy note appears:

> "Last time you traveled with us (2039), you preferred fewer vehicle switches."

**Screen: Values**

Before showing options, the system asks one clarifying question:

> "For this journey, what should we optimize for first?"

Pills:
- Keeping the kids comfortable
- Minimizing total emissions
- Not feeling rushed between cities
- Keeping costs close to past trips

Alex selects **Keeping the kids comfortable** and **Not feeling rushed**.

**Screen: Options**

Three movement stories appear, each showing estimated price and a small Axiom mark:

---

**1. Family Corridor — Rail spine, local autonomy**

*€2,400 – €2,800 estimated*

> "You mostly ride, we handle transfers. Familiar to your past trips, but with fewer handoffs."

Composition:
- High-speed rail between major cities (Berlin → Paris → Lyon)
- Autonomous family capsule at each arrival, sized for kids + luggage
- Final 5–6 days with a semi-private family pod near your stay

Why this fits:
- Mirrors your 2039 trip pacing
- Avoids >3 hour continuous drives
- Guarantees 1 non-travel day every 3 days

Interior preview: *[Image of family capsule interior—flexible seating, storage cubbies, soft lighting]*

---

**2. Slow Loop — Fewer places, deeper stays**

*€1,900 – €2,200 estimated*

> "For when the point is to be together, not to collect cities."

Fewer segments, more time in each place. Axiom takes an explicit stance against over-optimization.

Interior preview: *[Image of spacious pod with table, kids' activity area]*

---

**3. Emissions-Light — Kids first**

*€2,100 – €2,500 estimated*

Shows:
- Projected emissions vs. your last comparable trip (–34%)
- Walking time for kids vs. seated time

---

Below all options:

> "We've translated your request into 3 possible movement stories. You can adjust them without retyping."

**Screen: Confirmation**

Alex selects Family Corridor and adjusts one city. Final summary shows:
- Total estimated price: €2,640
- Payment method on file
- Trip added to "Your trips"

---

### Scene 2 — Airport: legacy meets autonomy

Maria lands at an airport that used to have rental counters. The old counters are now "movement lounges"—screens show real-time flows of autonomous fleets and rail connections. Staff are "mobility stewards", not sales agents.

**Notification on landing:**

> "Welcome back to Axiom. Your local movement plan is ready."

**Screen: Summary card**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Goal | Hotel in city center, 45 min away |
| Preferences | Low noise, low emissions, no ad-influenced routing |
| Mode applied | **Focus** |
| Trust level | Recognized (guest alias: SkyRider2049) |

Two options:

---

**1. Silent Corridor — Axiom-certified ad-free route**

*€18*

- Autonomous capsule, noise-limited
- Guaranteed no routing through sponsored detours
- Arrives 10 minutes slower than fastest, but predictable

Interior preview: *[Image of minimal capsule interior—muted tones, no screens, soft seat]*

---

**2. City Sampler — Scenic default from airport authority**

*€14*

- Mixed providers
- Includes detour past new waterfront district

---

Small note:

> "In 2043 you opted out of ad-influenced routes. We continue to honor that."

**After confirmation:**

Maria sees the trip in "Your trips" with ETA and capsule location updating live.

---

### Scene 3 — Workplace: subscription, not booking

A project manager types into the same central field on web:

> "For Q3, we'll have 12 engineers commuting to the edge-of-city campus 3 days a week. Can you propose a plan that minimizes burnout and emissions, even if it costs more than standard shuttles?"

**Screen: Understanding**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Cohort | 12 people |
| Cadence | 3 days/week |
| Duration | Q3 (Jul–Sep) |
| Constraints | Low burnout, low emissions |
| Budget | Flexible within 15% of standard |
| Mode applied | **Focus** (commute context) |

**Screen: Proposal**

Instead of offering a fleet, Axiom proposes:

1. Staggered arrival corridors to avoid rush hours
2. Mixed-use pods with quiet work zones + social zones
3. Explicit "no meetings during transit" policy suggestion

Estimated quarterly cost: €28,400 (12% above standard shuttle baseline)

Small copy:

> "In 2050, our role isn't just to move bodies, but to protect headspace. This plan assumes your company supports that."

---

## 6. System POV

How Axiom thinks behind the scenes.

### Principles

- Every request is a **movement narrative**, not an asset booking.
- Always balance three tensions:
  - Automation efficiency vs. human legibility
  - Environmental impact vs. emotional comfort
  - Individual optimization vs. collective fairness

### Decision hierarchy

1. **Start from intention** — Why does this person need to move at all?
2. **Map constraints** — Time, bodies, accessibility, emotional states, climate.
3. **Infer experience mode** — Apply the most fitting tag based on signals.
4. **Generate stories** — 2–4 plausible movement narratives with clear tradeoffs.
5. **Surface with transparency** — Show assumptions, allow adjustment, never hide.

### AI behavior

- Transparent about assumptions: *"We assumed your kids don't like transfers after 9pm."*
- Occasionally paternalistic, but explainable: *"We don't route through high-risk climate zones even if it's faster."*
- Never asks more than one clarifying question per intent.
- Shows uncertainty as ranges, not warnings.

---

## 7. Trust and pricing

### Trust levels

| Level | How achieved | Effect |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Guest** | No interaction yet | Cannot book, can explore |
| **Recognized** | First intent submitted; system generates alias (e.g., SkyRider2049) | Can book; small trust margin in pricing |
| **Trusted** | User provides real name | Trust margin removed; slightly lower prices |

Trust is shown in the UI but never gamified. It's a signal of relationship, not a loyalty program.

### Pricing model

Axiom uses experience-based pricing, not vehicle-based pricing.

Factors:
- Duration and distance
- Time of day (peak vs. off-peak)
- Urgency (now vs. planned ahead)
- Autonomy confidence (fully autonomous conditions = lower cost)
- Experience mode (Private and Focus cost more than Shared)

Planning ahead reduces cost because it improves fleet allocation efficiency and reduces peak energy usage.

Prices are always shown as **ranges** until final confirmation, reflecting real uncertainty in 2050 systems.

---

## 8. Guardrails

What Axiom never does.

- Never reduces people to "utilization units" in UI copy.
- Never hides high-risk decisions behind cheerful AI language.
- Never defaults to the most profitable route when it conflicts with stated user values.
- Never requires account creation to complete a booking.
- Never uses urgency, guilt, or artificial scarcity to influence decisions.
- Never shares location or travel patterns with external parties.
- Never shows ads or third-party offers inside the journey.
- Never reverts to "car rental" metaphors except in moments of deliberate nostalgia.

---

## 9. Open questions

For future exploration:

- How does Axiom show its legacy in the interface without feeling stuck in the past?
- What rituals or visuals replace "picking up keys at a counter"?
- How are disputes with autonomous systems resolved—who does the user call when things go wrong?
- How does Axiom signal that its AI is aligned with the user, not with advertisers or city politics?
- How does the system handle mid-journey failures or changes?
- How does accessibility surface—does the system ask, infer, or remember?

---

## 10. Implementation notes

This vision script is designed to guide a front-end demo with the following structure:

1. **Home page** — Single input field for intent
2. **API route** — Returns mocked `TripPlan` JSON (hardcoded initially)
3. **Trip plan component** — Renders the structured understanding, options, and confirmation flow

Once the UI feels right, the mock can be swapped for a real model call. The prompt and response structure should mirror the scenes described above.
